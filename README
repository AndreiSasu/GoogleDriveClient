		SyncThemAll
		-----------
		A  Linux command line Google Drive Client 
		Written in Python, released under GPL
		Uses pyinotify to get events from the filesystem: https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify
```
--start: 
            Should NOT be used on very busy filesystems!
            Specify a list of absolute paths, like this:
            python main.py --start /var /home /root

--stop:
	Attempts a graceful shutdown of the SyncThemAll daemon process.

--initialize: 
            Should be run only once, when setting the application up.
            If successful, it will create a file called "credstore.json" in the folder where the main.py program resides.
            python main.py --initialize 1077359083816-49381jdfmbfqj4m1sb2ub8tmdt7ddu6n.apps.googleusercontent.com H4GgY3jXg1GhQ3BQ1WMBJU8-

--download: 
            Downloads the contents of a Google Drive folder to the local filesystem
            Should be called like this: 
            python main.py --download <local folder name (abspath)> <gdrive folder name>
            python main.py --download /tmp/temp SyncThemAll

--upload: 
        Uploads the contents of a local folder to Google Drive:
        python main.py --upload /var/temp SyncThemAll
```



Configuration steps:
-----------------------

1.) Install the prerequisites, here is an example via pip: 
```
pip install pyinotify 
pip install google-api-python-client

```
2.) Configure the authorization process:
Go to: https://code.google.com/apis/console/ + make sure under "Services", Drive API and Drive SDK are enabled.

Under API Access:

-> create a new Client ID, with: **Application Type**: *Installed application*, **Installed application type**: *other*

Select the Client ID and Client Secret generated, for example:


```
Client ID: 1077359083816-koufetqto29kjres3icm9ghjdt7o49kg.apps.googleusercontent.com
Client secret:	5YuYZQfgCDITUu7BmocdxcH8
Redirect URIs:	urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob
http://localhost
```

Run the initialization with the above parameters:
```
python main.py --initialize 1077359083816-koufetqto29kjres3icm9ghjdt7o49kg.apps.googleusercontent.com 5YuYZQfgCDITUu7BmocdxcH8
```
A message similar to the following will be shown:
```
Go to the following link in your browser: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdrive+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdrive.file+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.email+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.profile&redirect_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Awg%3Aoauth%3A2.0%3Aoob&response_type=code&client_id=1077359083816-koufetqto29kjres3icm9ghjdt7o49kg.apps.googleusercontent.com&access_type=offline
Enter verification code:
```

After the authorization code has been stored, the file Config/credstore.json will be used for further authentication.


2.) Enable realtime synchronization on a folder: 
```
python main.py --start /home/andrei/GoogleDrive
```

The above process will detach and daemonize itself. It can be stopped using: 
```
python main.py --stop
```

Known issues / TODO LIST:
-------------------------

-> moving files / folders is not supported yet

-> file / folder exclusions are not supported yet

-> the process is not optimised for quickly creating / removing folder/file structures and you will experience huge delays on very busy filesystems ( lots of create and delete operations )

-> no support for symlinks yet

-> no support for empty files yet
